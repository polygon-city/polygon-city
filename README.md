# polygon-city

polygon.city is a project aimed at collecting, converting, and distributing open-source 3D building data. Its current focus is the conversion of [CityGML files](http://www.citygml.org/?id=1539) into more easily-parseable flat object files using https://github.com/polygon-city/polygon-city-cli.

Right now we're looking at these cities in particular: https://github.com/polygon-city/polygon-city-cli/issues/22

And here are a couple of works in progress:

- Linz, Germany: https://github.com/polygon-city/polygon-city-linz-export
- Berlin, Germany: https://github.com/polygon-city/polygon-city-berlin-export
